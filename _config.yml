          Electrocardiograph capable of recording and transmitting data, using the Bluetooth communication protocol, to a computer. Microcontroller technology was used to implement the electrocardiograph and LABVIEW to develop the program to receive and process data in order to show the electrocardiogram in the computer screen. Data are stored in an EEPROM memory for further analysis.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
