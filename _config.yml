  Hi there!

  My name is Yeser Alfredo Morales, an electronics engineer at the University national of Engineering in Nicaragua, Since 2017 I see the potential of ROS like all that an entrepreneur Roboticist needs to make a career in Robotics.   
  
  Tesis Work: “Virtual laboratory for industrial robotics using ROS middleware and compatible tools”.
  
  Ask me about: Kinematics Robotics using KDL, Pluging of Rviz - ROS, And Computer Vision using OpenCV

          Electrocardiograph capable of recording and transmitting data, using the Bluetooth communication protocol, to a computer. Microcontroller technology was used to implement the electrocardiograph and LABVIEW to develop the program to receive and process data in order to show the electrocardiogram in the computer screen. Data are stored in an EEPROM memory for further analysis.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
